For the program to not output "BOOM!!!", the first three numbers the user submits must add up to the fourth number (on the second scanf call).
If the first three numbers do not add up to the fourth number, the program will output "BOOM!!!". If they do add up to the fourth number,
the program will output "Congrat!!!".

For example, inputting "1 3 5" and then "9" will output "Congrat!!!" but "1 3 5" and "8" will outpput "BOOM!!!".
