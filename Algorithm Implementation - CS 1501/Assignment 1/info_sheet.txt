Does your program run without error?:
    My program takes a long time to enumerate all good passwords. It takes about 15 minutes. This is because when populating the my_dictionary trie,
    I didnt figure out how to get all possible combinations of number/letter substitions. The majority of them are there, but there are some that aren't.
    This makes the program still go through these password combinations.

    The user input for good/bad passwords does not work at all.

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
    My program can enumerate all good passwords but you have to let it sit for around 15 minutes. I obviously did not prune correctly.
